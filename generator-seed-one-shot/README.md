Sovereign Seed Generator

Welcome to the Sovereign Seed Generator, an open-source test project that allows you to generate a 12‑word seed phrase compliant with the BIP‑39 standard.

This project was created as part of my application to Holberton School, to demonstrate my skills in web development and crypto security.

🚀 How It Works

    The generator is contained in a single index.html file, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

    It can be opened directly in any browser:

        On a computer (Windows, Linux, Mac): simply double‑click the file and it will open immediately.

        On a smartphone (iPhone or Android):

            Download a free HTML text editor from the App Store or Play Store (e.g., HTML Viewer).

            Open the index.html file in the editor.

            Disconnect from the Internet and use it offline for maximum security.

    ⚡ Important: Your seed phrase never leaves your device.

📖 User Guide

    Go to the GitHub repository and download the index.html file.

    Open the file:

        On a computer: directly in your browser.

        On a smartphone: in a free HTML editor from the App Store or Play Store.

    Click “Generate Your Five Words”:

        A list of 2048 words will open.

        You can choose the language (French or English).

    Select 5 words of your choice:

        To enhance randomness, scroll through the list with your mouse wheel, close your eyes, and click randomly.

    Once your 5 words are selected, the “Generate Your Seed” button becomes active.

    Click it to instantly generate a full 12‑word seed phrase.

    Below the result, you’ll find 3 links to trusted verification tools that you can check once you reconnect to the Internet.

🔑 BIP‑39 Standard – Already Usable

    The generator produces 12‑word mnemonic phrases fully compliant with the BIP‑39 standard.

    These seed phrases are immediately valid and usable:

        Simply enter them into the crypto wallet of your choice (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, XRP, etc.).

        The wallet will automatically generate the correct address according to its own derivation scheme.

    In a future version, this generator will integrate derivation paths to directly provide blockchain‑specific wallet addresses.

🔍 Compatibility Verification

You can verify your seed phrase with these trusted tools:

    Ian Coleman’s BIP39 Tool

    Coinplate Recovery

    OneKey BIP39 Tool

🎯 Project Goal

This is currently a functional demonstration for my Holberton School application.
Its goals are:

    to already provide valid and immediately usable seed phrases,

    and to evolve into a complete tool capable of generating wallet addresses (BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL, etc.) through integrated derivation paths.
